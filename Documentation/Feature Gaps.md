# Feature Gap Analysis & Technical Roadmap

This document analyzes the collective needs of all defined user personas to identify the core features, data models, and technical components required to build the fitness application. Items are prioritized based on the persona hierarchy.

**Persona Priority Levels:**
-   **P0:** The Selection Athlete
-   **P1:** The Weight Loss Seeker, The Strength Builder
-   **P2:** The F3 Enthusiast, The Busy Professional
-   **P3:** The Complete Beginner, The Active Senior

## 1. Core Application Features

This section outlines the user-facing features required to meet the needs of the personas.

| Priority | Feature Name | Description | Required By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0** | **AI Multi-Discipline Planner** | Generates a comprehensive, periodized training plan integrating various disciplines (run, ruck, swim, strength). The core of the P0 experience. | Selection Athlete |
| **P0** | **Dynamic Plan Adjustments** | Automatically modifies the user's plan based on performance trends, workout adherence, and subjective feedback (e.g., fatigue levels). | Selection Athlete |
| **P0** | **Advanced Nutrition Coaching** | Estimates caloric/macro needs based on high-volume activity. Adjusts recommendations based on performance goals and logged data. | Selection Athlete |
| **P0** | **Detailed Workout Logger** | Allows users to log detailed metrics for various activities: time, distance, pace (for cardio), and weight, sets, reps (for strength). | Selection Athlete, Strength Builder |
| **P1** | **Basic Program Generator** | Creates simple, sustainable workout plans for general fitness goals like weight loss or muscle gain. | Weight Loss Seeker, Strength Builder |
| **P1** | **Program Library** | A library of pre-built, well-known training programs (e.g., PPL, 5/3/1, Couch to 5K) that users can select and customize. | Strength Builder, Weight Loss Seeker |
| **P1** | **Basic Nutrition Tracker** | Simple calorie and macro tracking with a focus on hitting daily targets. Less complex than the P0 version. | Weight Loss Seeker |
| **P1** | **Progress & Consistency Trackers** | Visual tools to track body weight, measurements, workout streaks, and personal records (PRs). | All Personas |
| **P2** | **Custom Exercise Library & Alias System** | Allows users to define their own exercises and map them to traditional names (e.g., "American Hammer" -> "Sit-up with weight press"). | F3 Enthusiast |
| **P2** | **Context-Aware Workout Generator** | Generates a workout on-the-fly based on user inputs like "available time" and "available equipment." | Busy Professional |
| **P2** | **Workout Sharing** | Ability to share a workout plan or a specific workout with others via a link or social media. | F3 Enthusiast |
| **P3** | **Educational Content Module** | A library of articles and videos explaining foundational concepts, proper exercise form, and basic nutrition. | Complete Beginner, Active Senior |
| **P3** | **Accessibility & Simplicity Mode** | UI option for larger fonts, simpler navigation, and clearer icons. | Active Senior |

## 2. Core Data Models

This section describes the necessary data structures to store and manage application information.

| Priority | Data Model | Fields & Description | Required By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0** | **User** | `UserID`, `Name`, `Email`, `Goals`, `PersonaType`, `CurrentMetrics` (weight, height, etc.), `PlanID` | All Personas |
| **P0** | **WorkoutSession** | `SessionID`, `UserID`, `Timestamp`, `PlannedExercises`, `LoggedExercises`, `SubjectiveFeedback` (fatigue, soreness), `Duration` | All Personas |
| **P0** | **TrainingPlan** | `PlanID`, `UserID`, `StartDate`, `EndDate`, `Goal`, `Phases` (e.g., Base, Build, Peak), `WeeklySchedule` | Selection Athlete, Strength Builder |
| **P0** | **Exercise** | `ExerciseID`, `Name`, `Description`, `VideoURL`, `MusclesTargeted`, `Type` (Cardio, Strength, etc.), `Aliases` | All Personas |
| **P0** | **NutritionLog** | `LogID`, `UserID`, `Timestamp`, `FoodItem`, `Calories`, `Protein`, `Carbs`, `Fat` | Selection Athlete, Weight Loss Seeker |
| **P1** | **ProgramTemplate** | `TemplateID`, `Name`, `Description`, `TargetGoal`, `Structure` (e.g., JSON defining the workout schedule) | Strength Builder, Weight Loss Seeker |
| **P2** | **UserDefinedExercise** | `UserExerciseID`, `UserID` (creator), `Name`, `BaseExerciseID` (maps to a standard exercise), `CommunityApproval` | F3 Enthusiast |

## 3. Core Technical Components

This section outlines the key backend systems, AI models, and infrastructure needed.

| Priority | Component | Description | Required For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0** | **AI Coaching Engine** | A sophisticated model (likely a custom LLM or a series of them) that can generate and, more importantly, *dynamically adjust* complex training plans based on ongoing user data. This is the most significant technical challenge. | Dynamic Plan Adjustments, AI Multi-Discipline Planner |
| **P0** | **Performance Trend Analysis Service** | A data processing service that analyzes `WorkoutSession` data over time to identify positive/negative trends. It feeds its conclusions to the AI Coaching Engine. | Dynamic Plan Adjustments |
| **P0** | **Nutrition Estimation Model** | A model that calculates Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) based on user metrics and logged activity, then provides macro targets. | Advanced & Basic Nutrition Coaching |
| **P1** | **Database** | A robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store all the data models defined above. | All Features |
| **P1** | **Web/Mobile Frontend** | The user interface for the application, built with a modern framework (e.g., React, Swift, Kotlin). | All Features |
| **P1** | **Backend API** | A secure API (e.g., REST, GraphQL) to connect the frontend to the database and other backend services. | All Features |
| **P2** | **Exercise Alias/Mapping Service** | A service that can manage the community-driven dictionary of custom exercises and map them to the canonical `Exercise` table. | Custom Exercise Library |
| **P3** | **Content Management System (CMS)** | A system for creating, storing, and serving the educational video and text content for beginners and seniors. | Educational Content Module |
