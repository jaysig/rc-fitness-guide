## Common Technique Problems and Solutions

### Problem: Sinking Legs/Poor Body Position
**Causes**: Tight hip flexors, head too high, poor core engagement
**Solutions**:
- Practice superman float drill
- Press buoy drill for body position
- Core strengthening exercises
- Head position awareness training

### Problem: Crossing Over Midline
**Causes**: Poor shoulder rotation, reaching too far across body
**Solutions**:
- Single-arm drilling with emphasis on straight entry
- Catch-up drill with body rotation focus
- Visual cues for hand entry position
- Shoulder flexibility work

### Problem: Breathing Disrupts Stroke
**Causes**: Lifting head instead of rotating, poor timing
**Solutions**:
- Side balance drill
- 6-3-6 drill for rotation development
- Breathing to both sides practice
- Gradual breathing pattern progression

### Problem: Inefficient Kick
**Causes**: Kicking from knees, too large amplitude, poor timing
**Solutions**:
- Kick drills with focus on hip initiation
- Streamline kick for technique
- Kick with fins for feel
- Vertical kicking for body position
