## Program Notes
This program is designed for triathletes who want to excel in the swim portion of their race while conserving energy for the bike and run. The focus is on efficiency, endurance, and race-specific skills rather than pure swimming speed. Success requires consistency, patience with technique development, and trust in the training process.

The program can be adapted for any triathlon distance by adjusting volume, intensity, and specific race preparation elements. Key to success is building a strong aerobic base while maintaining excellent technique under fatigue.

Remember: In triathlon, the goal is to exit the water feeling strong and ready for the bike leg, not to win the swim at the expense of overall race performance.
