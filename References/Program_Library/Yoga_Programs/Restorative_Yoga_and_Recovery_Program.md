## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

### "I Feel More Emotional During Practice"
**Understanding:**
- Emotional release is normal and healthy part of healing
- Body stores emotions, and relaxation can allow them to surface
- Crying, anger, or sadness during practice is therapeutic

**Solution:**
- Allow emotions without trying to change or stop them
- Breathe through difficult feelings with self-compassion
- Consider trauma-informed therapy if emotions feel overwhelming
- Journal about insights and feelings after practice

### "I Fall Asleep During Practice"
**Understanding:**
- Sleep during restorative practice indicates needed rest
- Chronic sleep debt may initially override conscious relaxation
- Body is learning to distinguish rest from sleep

**Solution:**
- Allow sleep when body needs it, especially initially
- Gradually work toward conscious relaxation as rest debt decreases
- Practice in slightly cooler room or less comfortable position
- Use gentle music or guided meditations to maintain awareness

### "I Feel Anxious Being Still"
**Understanding:**
- Stillness can initially increase anxiety in busy, stressed individuals
- Nervous system may be accustomed to constant stimulation
- Anxiety often arises when we slow down enough to feel it

**Solution:**
- Start with shorter holds and gradually increase duration
- Keep eyes open or partially open if closed eyes increase anxiety
- Use movement-based restorative poses initially
- Focus on breath as anchor during anxious moments

### "I Don't Feel Any Different"
**Understanding:**
- Restorative benefits are often subtle and cumulative
- Changes in nervous system function take time to manifest
- Benefits may be noticed first by others or in stressful situations

**Solution:**
- Track objective measures like sleep quality and stress responses
- Practice consistently for at least 4-6 weeks before evaluating
- Ask trusted friends or family if they notice changes
- Focus on process rather than outcomes

### "I Don't Have Time for Long Sessions"
**Understanding:**
- Restorative yoga requires time investment for maximum benefit
- Short, consistent practice is better than irregular long sessions
- Even 10-15 minutes can provide nervous system benefits

**Solution:**
- Start with 15-20 minute essential sequences
- Use micro-practices throughout the day (5-minute stress resets)
- Combine restorative poses with activities like TV watching
- Prioritize quality over quantity in shorter sessions
