# 5/3/1 Program by Jim Wendler

## Program Overview
The 5/3/1 program is a strength training methodology created by Jim Wendler that focuses on slow, steady progression in the main compound lifts. Built around percentages of your one-rep max (1RM), this program emphasizes consistent progress over time while allowing for customization through various assistance work templates.

## Program Goals
- Develop maximum strength in the "big four" lifts
- Establish consistent, measurable progress
- Build a strong foundation for advanced training
- Develop mental toughness through challenging top sets

## Target Audience
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate to Advanced (1+ years consistent training)
- **Training Days**: 3-4 days per week
- **Session Duration**: 45-75 minutes
- **Equipment Needed**: Barbell, plates, squat rack, bench

## Prerequisites
- Established 1RM or reliable estimate for all four main lifts
- Solid understanding of proper form on compound movements
- Ability to calculate percentages accurately
- Patience for slow, methodical progress

## The Four Main Lifts
1. **Back Squat**
2. **Bench Press**

4. **Overhead Press**

## Weekly Schedule Structure

### 4-Day Template (Recommended)
- **Monday**: Overhead Press + Assistance

- **Friday**: Squat + Assistance

### 3-Day Template (Alternative)

## Core 5/3/1 Structure

### Training Max Calculation
- Start with 90% of your true 1RM as your "Training Max" (TM)
- All percentages are calculated from your Training Max, not true max
- This built-in safety margin ensures quality reps and consistent progress

### 4-Week Cycle Structure

#### Week 1: 5's Week
- Set 1: 65% × 5 reps
- Set 2: 75% × 5 reps
- Set 3: 85% × 5+ reps (AMRAP - as many reps as possible)

#### Week 2: 3's Week
- Set 1: 70% × 3 reps
- Set 2: 80% × 3 reps
- Set 3: 90% × 3+ reps (AMRAP)

#### Week 3: 5/3/1 Week
- Set 1: 75% × 5 reps
- Set 2: 85% × 3 reps
- Set 3: 95% × 1+ reps (AMRAP)

#### Week 4: Deload Week
- Set 1: 60% × 5 reps
- Set 2: 65% × 5 reps
- Set 3: 70% × 5 reps

### After Each Cycle
- Add 5 lbs to your Training Max for squat and deadlift
- Add 2.5 lbs to your Training Max for bench press and overhead press
- Recalculate all percentages for the next cycle
