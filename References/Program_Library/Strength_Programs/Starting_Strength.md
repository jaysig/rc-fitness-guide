# Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe

## Program Overview
Starting Strength is a novice strength training program designed by Mark Rippetoe that focuses on linear progression in the basic compound movements. The program is built around the principle that novice trainees can recover from and adapt to training stress within 48-72 hours, allowing for session-to-session strength increases.

## Program Goals
- Develop a strong foundation in basic movement patterns
- Maximize strength gains during the novice phase
- Learn proper technique under progressively heavier loads
- Build the habits and mindset for long-term strength training

## Target Audience
- **Experience Level**: Complete beginners to early intermediate
- **Training Days**: 3 days per week (alternating days)
- **Session Duration**: 45-75 minutes
- **Equipment Needed**: Barbell, plates, squat rack, bench, deadlift platform

## Prerequisites
- Commitment to consistent training 3x per week
- Willingness to learn proper technique
- Access to basic barbell equipment
- Understanding that strength gains require progressive overload

## The Starting Strength Lifts

### Primary Movements
1. **Low-Bar Back Squat** - Foundation movement, trained every session
2. **Deadlift** - King of all exercises, alternated with power clean
3. **Bench Press** - Upper body pressing strength
4. **Overhead Press** - Functional overhead strength
5. **Power Clean** - Explosive power development (optional/advanced)

## Starting Weights and Progression

### Day 1: Finding Starting Weights
1. **Empty barbell warm-up**: 2 sets × 5 reps
2. **Progressive loading**: Add 10-20 lbs and perform 5 reps
3. **Continue adding weight** until form breaks down or speed decreases
4. **Starting weight**: Use the last weight where all 5 reps were completed with good form

### Linear Progression Protocol

#### Squat Progression
- **Workout 1-10**: Add 10 lbs per session
- **Workout 11-20**: Add 5 lbs per session
- **Workout 21+**: Add 5 lbs when all sets completed

#### Deadlift Progression
- **First 2-3 weeks**: Add 15-20 lbs per session
- **Weeks 4-8**: Add 10 lbs per session
- **Week 9+**: Add 5-10 lbs per session

#### Bench Press/Overhead Press Progression
- **First 2-3 weeks**: Add 5-10 lbs per session
- **Week 4+**: Add 2.5-5 lbs per session
- Use microplates (1.25 lb) when available for smaller increments

## Detailed Exercise Execution

### Low-Bar Back Squat
**Setup:**
- Bar position: On rear deltoids, not neck
- Grip: Hands as close as flexibility allows
- Stance: Shoulder-width, toes slightly out

**Execution:**
- Initiate with hip drive
- Knees track over toes
- Descend until hip crease below knee cap
- Drive through heels to stand

**Common Errors:**
- Knee cave on ascent
- Forward lean/chest drop
- Insufficient depth
- Rising hips without chest

### Deadlift
**Setup:**
- Bar over mid-foot
- Stance: Hip-width apart
- Grip: Just outside legs, mixed or double overhand

**Execution:**
- Chest up, shoulders over bar
- Drive through heels
- Keep bar close to body
- Lock out hips and knees simultaneously

**Common Errors:**
- Bar drifting away from body
- Hyperextending at top
- Rolling bar forward on setup
- Uneven grip causing rotation

### Bench Press
**Setup:**
- Eyes under bar
- Shoulder blades retracted
- Arch in lower back
- Feet firmly planted

**Execution:**
- Lower bar to chest (nipple line)
- Press in straight line over shoulders
- Full lockout at top

**Common Errors:**
- Bouncing off chest
- Pressing toward feet
- Loss of upper back tightness
- Feet moving during lift

### Overhead Press
**Setup:**
- Bar resting on anterior delts
- Grip slightly wider than shoulders
- Wrists straight
- Core braced

**Execution:**
- Press straight up
- Move head back as bar passes
- Lock out directly over shoulders
- Return to starting position

**Common Errors:**
- Pressing forward instead of up
- Not moving head back
- Incomplete lockout
- Using legs (push press)

## Warm-up Protocol

### Standard Warm-up Sequence
1. **Empty Bar**: 2 sets × 5 reps
2. **Intermediate Sets**: Add weight in 3-5 jumps to working weight
3. **Final Warm-up**: Single set at 90% of working weight

### Example Squat Warm-up (Working weight: 225 lbs)
- 45 lbs × 5 reps × 2 sets
- 95 lbs × 5 reps
- 135 lbs × 3 reps
- 185 lbs × 2 reps
- 205 lbs × 1 rep
- 225 lbs × 5 reps × 3 sets (working sets)

## When Linear Progression Stalls

### Reset Protocol
1. **First Stall**: Deload 10% and work back up
2. **Second Stall**: Deload 15% and work back up
3. **Third Stall**: Move to intermediate programming

### Signs of Program Completion
- Multiple resets with no progress
- Inability to recover between sessions
- Consistent form breakdown
- Plateau lasting 3+ weeks despite resets

## Adaptation Guidelines

### For Older Beginners (40+)
- Start with lighter weights
- Progress more slowly (2.5 lbs instead of 5 lbs)
- Consider extra rest day between sessions
- Focus heavily on mobility and warm-up

### For Female Trainees
- Use smaller weight increments (2.5 lbs for squats)
- May progress longer than males
- Consider bodyweight assistance exercises earlier
- Same technique standards apply

### For Youth Athletes
- Emphasize technique over weight
- More conservative starting weights
- Additional mobility work
- Supervision recommended

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Programming Errors
- Adding extra exercises too early
- Skipping sessions regularly
- Not following prescribed progression
- Modifying the program prematurely

### Technical Errors
- Rushing through learning curve
- Ignoring mobility limitations
- Poor warm-up habits
- Inconsistent technique

### Recovery Errors
- Inadequate sleep (less than 7 hours)
- Poor nutrition habits
- Excessive cardio or other activities
- Not managing life stress

## Expected Results Timeline

### Month 1: Foundation Building
- Rapid initial strength gains (neuromuscular adaptation)
- Learning movement patterns
- Establishing training rhythm
- Potential soreness and fatigue

### Month 2-3: Linear Gains
- Consistent session-to-session increases
- Improved technique under load
- Increased confidence with heavier weights
- Noticeable physique changes

### Month 4-6: Strength Development
- Substantial increases in all lifts
- Approach to genetic potential for linear gains
- Need for program modifications
- Transition planning to intermediate program

## Nutrition Guidelines

### Caloric Needs
- **Gaining Phase**: Eat in surplus to support strength gains
- **Maintenance**: Match intake to activity level
- **Cutting**: Not recommended during novice phase

### Macronutrient Priorities
1. **Protein**: 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight
2. **Carbohydrates**: Support training and recovery
3. **Fats**: 20-30% of total calories

### Meal Timing
- Pre-workout: Light meal 1-2 hours before
- Post-workout: Protein and carbs within 2 hours
- Throughout day: Regular meals every 3-4 hours

## Recovery Protocols

### Sleep Requirements
- 7-9 hours per night minimum
- Consistent sleep/wake times
- Quality sleep environment

### Rest Days
- Complete rest from training
- Light activity okay (walking, stretching)
- Focus on recovery activities

### Stress Management
- Monitor training stress vs life stress
- Adjust program when overwhelmed
- Use deload weeks when needed

## Transition to Intermediate Programming

### When to Move On
- Linear progression no longer sustainable
- Multiple unsuccessful resets
- Training age of 6-12 months
- Strength levels approaching intermediate standards

### Intermediate Program Options
- Texas Method
- 5/3/1 for beginners
- Madcow 5×5
- The Bridge (Barbell Medicine)

## Notes
Starting Strength is designed to extract maximum strength gains from the novice period. Stick to the program as written, focus on technique development, and trust the process. The simplicity is intentional and effective.
