- **Session Duration**: 45-90 minutes
- **Equipment Needed**: Barbell, plates, squat rack, bench

## Prerequisites
- Commitment to consistent 3x per week training
- Access to basic barbell equipment
- Willingness to start with light weights
- Understanding of proper form fundamentals

## The Five Exercises

### Core Movements
1. **Squat** - Trained every workout (3x per week)

## Starting Weights and Progression

### Recommended Starting Weights

#### If You Can Squat the Empty Bar (45 lbs)
- **Squat**: 45 lbs
- **Bench Press**: 45 lbs
- **Barbell Row**: 65 lbs
- **Overhead Press**: 45 lbs
- **Deadlift**: 95 lbs

#### If You Cannot Squat the Empty Bar
- Start with bodyweight exercises
- Use lighter barbells or dumbbells
- Progress to empty barbell when ready

### Linear Progression Protocol

#### Standard Progression
- **Squat, Bench, Row, OHP**: Add 5 lbs every workout
- **Deadlift**: Add 10 lbs every workout

#### Microloading (When 5 lb jumps become difficult)
- Use 2.5 lb plates or microplates
- **Upper body lifts**: Add 2.5 lbs per workout
- **Lower body lifts**: Add 5 lbs per workout

## Detailed Workout Structure

### Pre-Workout
- **Dynamic warm-up**: 5-10 minutes
- **Mobility work**: Focus on problem areas
- **Mental preparation**: Review workout plan

### Workout Execution

#### Sets and Rest Periods
- **Work sets**: 5 sets × 5 reps (except deadlift)
- **Rest between sets**: 1.5-3 minutes early on, 3-5 minutes as weight increases
- **Rest between exercises**: 3-5 minutes

#### Warm-up Sets
Perform warm-up sets before your working weight:
- Empty bar × 5 reps × 2 sets
- Add weight in 2-4 jumps to reach working weight
- Final warm-up set should be close to working weight

### Example Session (Workout A - 185 lb squat working weight)
**Squat Warm-up:**
- 45 lbs × 5 reps × 2 sets
- 95 lbs × 5 reps
- 135 lbs × 3 reps
- 165 lbs × 2 reps

**Squat Working Sets:**
- 185 lbs × 5 reps × 5 sets

**Bench Press** (similar warm-up protocol)
**Barbell Row** (similar warm-up protocol)

## Dealing with Stalls and Plateaus

### First Stall Protocol
When you fail to complete 5×5 (get fewer than 25 total reps):

1. **Attempt same weight next workout**
2. **If you fail again, deload 10%**
3. **Work back up with normal progression**

### Deload Example
If you stall at 200 lbs squat:
- Deload to 180 lbs (200 × 0.9)
- Next workout: 185 lbs
- Following workout: 190 lbs
- Continue until you surpass previous stall weight

### Multiple Stalls
After 2-3 deloads on the same exercise:
- Consider switching to 3×5 for that exercise
- After more stalls, switch to 1×5 (except squat)
- Eventually transition to intermediate program

## Program Modifications

### For Absolute Beginners
- Start with bodyweight movements
- Use goblet squats before barbell squats
- Focus on mobility and movement quality
- Consider personal training sessions initially

### For Older Beginners (40+)
- Start with lighter weights
- Progress more slowly (2.5 lbs instead of 5 lbs)
- Add extra rest day if needed
- Focus on mobility and recovery

### For Athletes
- Maintain sport-specific training
- Adjust volume based on sport demands
- Consider in-season modifications
- Monitor overall training stress

## Accessory Work Guidelines

### First 12 Weeks
- **No accessories recommended**
- Focus on mastering the five exercises
- Let your body adapt to the program

### After 12 Weeks (Optional)
- **Pull-ups/Chin-ups**: 3 sets to failure
- **Dips**: 3 sets × 8-12 reps
- **Planks**: 3 sets × 30-60 seconds
- **Face pulls**: 3 sets × 15-20 reps

### Advanced Accessories (6+ months)
- **Barbell curls**: For arm development
- **Close-grip bench press**: For triceps
- **Leg curls**: For hamstring balance
- **Calf raises**: For lower leg development

## Recovery and Lifestyle

### Sleep Requirements
- 7-9 hours per night minimum
- Consistent sleep schedule
- Quality sleep environment
- Avoid screens before bed

### Nutrition Guidelines
- **Protein**: 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight daily
- **Carbohydrates**: Support training and recovery
- **Fats**: 20-30% of total calories
- **Hydration**: Half your bodyweight in ounces of water daily

### Rest Day Activities
- Light walking or stretching
- Mobility work
- Stress management activities
- Complete rest from intense exercise

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Programming Errors
- Starting too heavy
- Adding exercises too early
- Skipping warm-up sets
- Not following deload protocol

### Technical Errors
- Ego lifting with poor form
- Rushing through reps
- Inadequate range of motion
- Ignoring safety protocols

### Recovery Errors
- Insufficient sleep
- Poor nutrition habits
- Training when overly fatigued
- Not managing life stress

- Noticeable muscle development
- Improved confidence with heavier weights
- Better understanding of program

### Month 5-6: Intermediate Transition

- Significant strength improvements
- Need for program evaluation

## Strength Standards and Progression

### Beginner Goals (First 6 months)
