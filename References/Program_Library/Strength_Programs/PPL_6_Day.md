# Push/Pull/Legs (PPL) 6-Day Program

## Program Overview
The Push/Pull/Legs split is one of the most effective intermediate to advanced training programs for building muscle mass and strength. This 6-day program alternates between push movements (chest, shoulders, triceps), pull movements (back, biceps), and leg movements (quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves).

## Program Goals
- Maximize muscle hypertrophy through high training frequency
- Develop balanced strength across all muscle groups
- Allow adequate recovery between muscle groups
- Progress steadily in compound and isolation movements

## Target Audience
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate to Advanced (6+ months consistent training)
- **Training Days**: 6 days per week
- **Session Duration**: 60-90 minutes
- **Equipment Needed**: Full gym access (barbells, dumbbells, cables, machines)

## Prerequisites
- Solid understanding of proper form on compound movements
- Ability to train 6 days per week consistently
- Experience with progressive overload principles
- No current injuries that would limit training

## Weekly Schedule Structure
- **Monday**: Push (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)
- **Tuesday**: Pull (Back, Biceps)
- **Wednesday**: Legs (Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves)
- **Thursday**: Push (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)
- **Friday**: Pull (Back, Biceps)
- **Saturday**: Legs (Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves)
- **Sunday**: Rest

## Progressive Overload Guidelines

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Focus on form and mind-muscle connection
- Use moderate weights (70-80% of maximum capability)
- Complete all prescribed reps and sets

### Week 3-4: Intensity Increase
- Increase weight by 2.5-5 lbs on compound movements
- Increase weight by 2.5 lbs on isolation movements
- Maintain rep ranges

### Week 5-6: Peak
- Continue progressive overload
- Consider adding extra set to lagging muscle groups
- Focus on perfect form at higher intensities

### Week 7: Deload
- Reduce weight by 10-15%
- Maintain same rep ranges and sets
- Prepare for next cycle

### Week 8+: New Cycle
- Start new cycle with increased baseline weights
- Consider exercise variations to prevent plateaus

## Adaptation Guidelines

### For Beginners (Modified Approach)
- Reduce to 4-5 days per week
- Start with bodyweight or light weights
- Focus on 2 compound movements per session
- Reduce isolation exercises to 2-3 per session

### For Advanced Trainees
- Add intensity techniques (drop sets, rest-pause)
- Increase training frequency to 7 days (add arm day)
- Incorporate periodization cycles
- Add pre-exhaust techniques

### For Time-Constrained Schedules
- Superset opposing muscle groups
- Reduce rest periods between sets
- Focus on compound movements
- Consider 4-day upper/lower split alternative

## Nutrition Considerations
- Consume adequate protein (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight)
- Maintain caloric surplus for muscle growth
- Time carbohydrates around workouts
- Stay hydrated throughout training

## Recovery Protocols
- Ensure 7-9 hours of quality sleep
- Take at least one full rest day per week
- Consider active recovery (light walking, stretching)
- Monitor for overtraining symptoms

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Ego lifting with poor form
- Skipping warm-up and cool-down
- Not tracking progressive overload
- Inconsistent training frequency
- Inadequate rest between sessions

## Expected Results Timeline
- **Weeks 1-4**: Improved strength and endurance
- **Weeks 5-8**: Noticeable muscle growth
- **Weeks 9-12**: Significant physique changes
- **3-6 months**: Substantial strength and size gains

## Program Modifications

### For Fat Loss
- Increase rest periods between sets
- Add 15-20 minutes cardio post-workout
- Maintain strength training intensity
- Create moderate caloric deficit

### For Strength Focus
- Reduce rep ranges to 3-6 reps on compounds
- Increase rest periods to 3-5 minutes
- Focus on progressive overload
- Reduce isolation work

## Notes
This program requires significant time commitment and recovery capacity. Listen to your body and adjust intensity as needed. Consider working with a qualified trainer for form checks and program modifications.
