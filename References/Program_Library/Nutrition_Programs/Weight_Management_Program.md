## Macro Calculation Framework

### Step 1: Determine Base Metabolic Rate (BMR)
**Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:**
- **Men**: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5
- **Women**: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161

### Step 2: Calculate Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
**Activity Multipliers:**
- Sedentary (office job, no exercise): BMR × 1.2
- Lightly active (light exercise 1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
- Moderately active (moderate exercise 3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55
- Very active (hard exercise 6-7 days/week): BMR × 1.725
- Extremely active (physical job + exercise): BMR × 1.9

### Step 3: Set Caloric Targets Based on Goals

#### Weight Loss
- **Conservative**: TDEE - 300-500 calories (0.5-1 lb/week)
- **Moderate**: TDEE - 500-750 calories (1-1.5 lbs/week)
- **Aggressive**: TDEE - 750-1000 calories (1.5-2 lbs/week)
- **Minimum**: Never below 1200 calories (women) or 1500 calories (men)

#### Weight Gain
- **Lean gaining**: TDEE + 200-400 calories (0.5-1 lb/week)
- **Moderate gaining**: TDEE + 400-600 calories (1-1.5 lbs/week)
- **Aggressive gaining**: TDEE + 600-800 calories (1.5-2 lbs/week)

#### Body Recomposition
- **At or slightly below TDEE** (deficit of 0-300 calories)
- **Focus on**: High protein, consistent training
- **Timeline**: Slower progress, 6-12 months

### Step 4: Distribute Macronutrients

#### Weight Loss Macros
- **Protein**: 2.0-2.4g per kg bodyweight (30-35% calories)
- **Fats**: 0.8-1.2g per kg bodyweight (25-30% calories)
- **Carbohydrates**: Remaining calories (35-45% calories)

#### Weight Gain Macros
- **Protein**: 1.8-2.2g per kg bodyweight (20-25% calories)
- **Fats**: 1.0-1.5g per kg bodyweight (25-30% calories)
- **Carbohydrates**: Remaining calories (45-55% calories)

#### Body Recomposition Macros
- **Protein**: 2.2-2.6g per kg bodyweight (30-35% calories)
- **Fats**: 0.8-1.2g per kg bodyweight (20-25% calories)
- **Carbohydrates**: Remaining calories (40-50% calories)
