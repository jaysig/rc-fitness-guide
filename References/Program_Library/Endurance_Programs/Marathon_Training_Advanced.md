- **Miles 11-20**: 82-85% HRmax
- **Miles 21-26.2**: 85-88% HRmax

## Advanced Fueling Strategy

### Daily Nutrition (Peak Training)

- **Protein**: 2.0-2.2g per kg body weight
- **Fat**: 1.0-1.2g per kg body weight
- **Hydration**: 50-60ml per kg body weight

### Pre-Long Run Protocol
**3-4 Hours Before**: 
- 1-4g carbs per kg body weight
- 500-700ml fluid with electrolytes
- Familiar foods: oatmeal, banana, toast

**1 Hour Before**: 
- 30-60g additional carbs if needed
- 200-300ml fluid
- Final bathroom stop

### During Long Runs/Race
- **Carbohydrates**: 60-90g per hour after first hour
- **Fluids**: 600-1000ml per hour based on conditions
- **Electrolytes**: 300-700mg sodium per hour
- **Practice race-day fueling in all long runs**

## Recovery and Adaptation

### Daily Recovery Protocols
- **Sleep**: 8-9 hours per night minimum
- **HRV Monitoring**: Track autonomic recovery
- **Nutrition**: Post-workout refueling within 30 minutes
- **Mobility**: 15-20 minutes daily stretching/foam rolling

### Weekly Recovery Management
- **Massage**: Professional massage every 2 weeks
- **Ice Baths**: 10-15 minutes after hard sessions
- **Compression**: Use compression garments for recovery

- Declining performance despite adequate recovery
- Persistent fatigue and irritability
- Recurring illness or injury
- Loss of motivation for training

**Response Protocol**:
- Immediate reduction in training volume (25-50%)

## Program Philosophy

This Advanced Marathon Training Program is built on the principle that marathon success requires a harmonious balance of aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and neuromuscular power. The 20-week periodization allows for systematic development of each energy system while maintaining the high training volumes necessary for elite marathon performance.

The program emphasizes patience in the base-building phase, courage during the threshold development phase, and wisdom in the speed integration and tapering phases. Mental training is equally important as physical preparation, as advanced marathon racing requires the ability to maintain pace when physiological and psychological stress are highest.

Success in this program requires complete commitment to the process, attention to recovery details, and trust in the systematic progression. The advanced marathoner must learn to balance the aggressive pursuit of ambitious goals with the intelligence to train sustainably for long-term development.

Remember that marathon racing at the advanced level is as much about race tactics, pacing discipline, and mental toughness as it is about pure fitness. Use this program as a foundation while developing the racing instincts and problem-solving abilities that separate good marathoners from great ones.
