# GoRuck Selection Preparation Program - 16 Week Build

**Program Type:** Selection Preparation - GoRuck Specific  
**Duration:** 16 weeks  
**Sessions per Week:** 5-6  
**Rest Days:** 1-2 per week  
**Focus:** Rucking endurance, team dynamics, mental toughness, selection simulation

*Preparing candidates for GoRuck Selection events through progressive load building, stress inoculation, and team-based challenges*

## What GoRuck Selection Entails

**Based on my knowledge, here's what GoRuck Selection involves:**

GoRuck Selection is an extreme endurance event that typically requires:
- **12-48+ hours of continuous movement** under stress and time pressure
- **Heavy ruck marching** (30+ lbs) for extended distances in all conditions
- **Team-based challenges** requiring leadership, cooperation, and problem solving
- **Individual challenges** testing your physical and mental breaking points
- **Sleep deprivation and minimal nutrition** - mental performance under stress
- **Obstacle navigation** and carrying/dragging teammates when they can't continue
- **Swimming with gear** (location dependent - some events include water crossings)
- **Equipment accountability** - lose your gear, you're out

**Here's what we need to improve:**
- Aerobic base and muscular endurance for 12-48 hour efforts
- Load-bearing capacity (rucking with heavy weight for long distances)
- Mental toughness and ability to perform under extreme discomfort
- Functional strength for team challenges (carries, drags, obstacle work)
- Swimming endurance with gear (if your event location requires it)
- Leadership and followership skills under fatigue and stress

**This program will cover:**
- Progressive ruck march training (systematically increasing distance and weight)
- Strength training focused on functional patterns and team challenges
- Mental resilience building through controlled discomfort training
- Team challenge simulations (if you have a training partner)
- Swimming integration (if needed for your specific event)
- Selection-specific scenarios and time management

## Customization Questions

**Before we proceed, I need to customize this program for your situation:**

1. **Training Partner:** "Do you have a training partner? Many GoRuck challenges are team-based and having someone to train with makes a huge difference."

2. **Equipment Access:** "What equipment do you have access to?"
   - Sandbags, kettlebells, or just basic gym equipment?
   - Ruck/backpack suitable for heavy loads?
   - Access to outdoor rucking terrain?

3. **Swimming Component:** "Does your specific GoRuck event include swimming? This varies by location and event type."

4. **Environment:** "Where will you be training?"
   - Can you ruck outdoors year-round?
   - Do you need treadmill alternatives?
   - Access to varied terrain (hills, sand, etc.)?

5. **Time Availability:** "How many hours per week can you dedicate to this preparation? GoRuck prep typically requires 8-12 hours of training weekly."

6. **Experience Level:** "What's your background?"
   - Previous military/law enforcement experience?
   - Endurance sports background?
   - Any previous GoRuck events?

**Based on your answers, I'll modify the program to:**
- Substitute exercises based on equipment availability
- Add team challenge alternatives if training solo
- Include/exclude swimming components
- Adjust volume based on time constraints
- Scale difficulty appropriately for experience level

## Program Philosophy

This program prepares candidates for GoRuck Selection using proven military selection methodologies:
- **Progressive Overload**: Systematic increase in ruck weight and distance
