# HIIT 4-Week Program

## Program Overview

High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) combines short bursts of intense exercise with periods of rest or lower-intensity recovery. This 4-week program progressively builds metabolic conditioning, improves cardiovascular health, and develops functional movement patterns while maximizing time efficiency.

## Philosophy

**Training Principles:**
- Maximum effort during work intervals
- Strategic rest for quality maintenance
- Progressive overload through intensity and complexity
- Functional movement emphasis
- Time-efficient workouts (20-45 minutes)
- Metabolic adaptation focus

**Physiological Benefits:**
- Improved VO2 max and aerobic capacity
- Enhanced anaerobic power
- Increased metabolic rate post-exercise (EPOC)
- Better insulin sensitivity
- Improved cardiovascular health
- Efficient fat burning

## Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Busy professionals seeking time-efficient workouts
- General fitness enthusiasts wanting metabolic improvement
- Athletes looking to enhance conditioning
- Individuals seeking fat loss and cardiovascular health

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic movement competency
- Ability to exercise at high intensity safely
- Understanding of proper form under fatigue
- Medical clearance for high-intensity exercise

**Fitness Level:** Beginner to Advanced (with appropriate scaling)

## Equipment Requirements

**Minimal Setup (Home/Travel):**
- Timer or smartphone app
- Exercise mat
- Water bottle
- Optional: Resistance bands, light dumbbells

**Gym Setup:**
- Cardio equipment (treadmill, bike, rower)

- Functional equipment (battle ropes, box, medicine ball)
- Space for bodyweight movements

**No Equipment Option:**
- All workouts can be performed with bodyweight only
- Focus on functional movement patterns

- Maintain proper form even when fatigued
- Hydrate appropriately

### Recovery Monitoring
- Track sleep quality and duration
- Monitor energy levels throughout day
- Watch for signs of overtraining
- Adjust intensity based on recovery

## Nutritional Considerations

### Pre-Workout (1-2 hours before)
- Light meal with carbohydrates and protein
- Avoid high fat or fiber foods
- Hydrate adequately
- Time eating appropriately

### During Workout
- Hydration with water
- Electrolyte replacement for longer sessions
- Listen to body's needs
- Avoid overdrinking

### Post-Workout (within 30-60 minutes)
- Protein for muscle recovery (20-30g)
- Carbohydrates for energy replenishment
- Continued hydration
- Real food preferred over supplements

## Program Completion and Next Steps
