## Scaling Guidelines

### Pull-Up Progressions
1. **Ring Rows** - Feet on ground, body angled
2. **Band-Assisted Pull-ups** - Thick to thin bands
3. **Jumping Pull-ups** - Jump up, control down
4. **Negative Pull-ups** - Jump up, slow descent
5. **Strict Pull-ups** - Full range of motion
6. **Kipping Pull-ups** - Efficient hip drive

### Push-Up Progressions
1. **Wall Push-ups** - Standing arm's length from wall
2. **Incline Push-ups** - Hands elevated on box/bench
3. **Knee Push-ups** - Knees on ground
4. **Full Push-ups** - Toes, full range of motion
5. **Ring Push-ups** - Unstable surface challenge

### Olympic Lifting Progressions
1. **PVC Pipe Practice** - Movement patterns only
2. **Empty Barbell** - 45lb/20kg bar work
3. **Light Weight** - Focus on speed and technique
4. **Moderate Weight** - Build strength and confidence
5. **Heavy Attempts** - Test maximal loads safely

### Conditioning Scaling
- **Reduce Rounds/Reps** - Maintain stimulus, reduce volume
- **Increase Rest** - Allow for recovery between efforts
- **Substitute Movements** - Use accessible alternatives
- **Adjust Time Domain** - Shorter workouts for beginners

## Common WOD Formats

### AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)
Set time limit, complete maximum rounds of prescribed movements.
*Example: AMRAP 15 minutes of 5-10-15 reps of three exercises*

### For Time
Complete prescribed work as quickly as possible.
*Example: 21-15-9 reps of two exercises for time*

### EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute)
Perform prescribed work at the start of each minute.
*Example: EMOM 12 minutes - 8 air squats + 6 push-ups*

### Tabata
20 seconds max effort, 10 seconds rest, for 8 rounds (4 minutes total).
*Example: Tabata air squats*

### Chipper
Single round of high-volume work, "chip away" at the reps.
*Example: 100-75-50-25 reps of four different exercises*

## Equipment Needed

### Essential Equipment
- **Pull-up bar** (or rings)
- **Light dumbbells** (15-35 lbs)
- **Kettlebell** (15-35 lbs)
- **Exercise bands**
- **Box or sturdy surface** for step-ups
- **Jump rope**
- **PVC pipe** for movement practice

### Gym Access Recommended
- **Olympic barbell and bumper plates**
- **Gymnastics rings**
- **Rowing machine or assault bike**
- **Wall ball**
- **Plyo boxes**

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Assessments
- **Movement Quality**: Video analysis or coach feedback
- **Strength Benchmarks**: Track weights used in main lifts
- **MetCon Performance**: Time or rounds completed
- **Skill Development**: Pull-ups, handstands, double-unders

### Benchmark Workouts
Test these classic CrossFit workouts monthly:
- **Cindy**: AMRAP 20 min of 5-10-15 (pull-ups, push-ups, air squats)
- **Fran**: 21-15-9 thrusters and pull-ups for time

### Body Composition & Fitness
- **Photos**: Monthly progress photos
- **Measurements**: Waist, shoulders, arms, legs
- **Performance**: Mile run time, max push-ups, etc.

## Safety Considerations

### Injury Prevention
- **Always warm up** thoroughly before intense work
- **Scale appropriately** - ego is the enemy
- **Focus on technique** over weight or speed
- **Listen to your body** - soreness vs. pain
- **Rest when needed** - recovery is part of training

### When to Scale Back
- **Poor movement quality** under fatigue
- **Excessive soreness** lasting more than 48 hours
- **Decreased performance** over multiple sessions
- **Loss of motivation** or enjoyment

### Progressive Loading
- **Increase intensity** only after movement quality is established
- **Add complexity** gradually (simple to complex)
- **Build work capacity** before adding external load
- **Master basics** before attempting advanced movements

## Nutrition Support

### CrossFit Nutrition Basics
- **Eat real food** - minimize processed foods
- **Adequate protein** - support recovery and adaptation
- **Time carbohydrates** around workouts for energy
- **Stay hydrated** throughout the day
- **Post-workout nutrition** within 30-60 minutes

### Performance Nutrition
- **Pre-workout**: Light carbs 30-60 minutes before
- **During workout**: Water for sessions under 60 minutes
- **Post-workout**: Protein and carbs for recovery
- **Daily intake**: Focus on whole foods and consistency

## Mental Approach

### CrossFit Mindset
- **Embrace discomfort** - growth happens outside comfort zone
- **Focus on yourself** - don't compare to others
- **Celebrate small wins** - every PR matters
- **Build community** - CrossFit is better together
- **Stay consistent** - frequency over perfection

### Setting Expectations
- **Month 1**: Learning movements, building base fitness
- **Month 2**: Improving technique, increasing intensity
- **Month 3**: Integrating skills, tackling classic workouts
- **Long-term**: Continuous improvement and community
