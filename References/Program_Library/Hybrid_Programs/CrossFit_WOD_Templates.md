# CrossFit WOD Templates

## Program Overview

CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program built on constantly varied functional movements performed at high intensity. This template library provides structured workout formats and programming guidelines for developing well-rounded functional fitness through the three modalities: metabolic conditioning, gymnastics, and weightlifting.

## Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
- Constantly Varied: Novel stimulus prevents accommodation
- Functional Movements: Multi-joint, natural patterns
- High Intensity: Relative to individual capacity
- Scalability: Adaptable for all fitness levels
- Community: Shared suffering and achievement

**Fitness Domains:**
1. Cardiovascular/Respiratory Endurance
2. Stamina
3. Strength
4. Flexibility
5. Power
6. Speed
7. Coordination
8. Agility
9. Balance
10. Accuracy
