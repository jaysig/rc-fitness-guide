# Functional HIIT Program - 8 Week Metabolic Conditioning

**Program Type:** High-Intensity Interval Training - Functional Fitness  
**Duration:** 8 weeks  
**Sessions per Week:** 4-5  
**Session Length:** 20-45 minutes  
**Focus:** Metabolic conditioning, bodyweight movements, time-efficient training

*Maximum results in minimum time through high-intensity functional movements*

## Program Philosophy

This program combines the principles of HIIT with functional movement patterns to deliver:
- **Time Efficiency**: Complete workouts in 20-45 minutes
- **Metabolic Conditioning**: Boost metabolism and enhance fat burning
- **Functional Movements**: Real-world applicable movement patterns
- **Equipment Minimal**: Most workouts require no equipment
- **Location Flexible**: Indoor and outdoor workout options
- **Scalable Intensity**: Adaptable for all fitness levels

## Training Principles

### HIIT Methodology
- **Work-to-Rest Ratios**: Structured intervals for maximum metabolic impact
- **Progressive Intensity**: Systematic increase in workout challenge
- **Movement Quality**: Maintain form even at high intensity
- **Recovery Integration**: Planned rest for adaptation and safety
- **Variety**: Prevent adaptation plateau through exercise variation

### Functional Movement Focus
- **Squat Pattern**: Foundation for lower body power and mobility
- **Hip Hinge**: Core strength and posterior chain development
- **Push/Pull**: Upper body strength and muscular balance
- **Core Stability**: Anti-extension, anti-rotation, and anti-lateral flexion
