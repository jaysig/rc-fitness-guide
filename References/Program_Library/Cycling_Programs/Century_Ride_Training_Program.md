## Century-Specific Fueling Strategy

### Pre-Century Fueling (2-3 days before)
**Carbohydrate Loading**: 8-10g per kg body weight daily
- Increase carb intake while reducing fiber
- Focus on familiar, easily digestible foods
- Examples: White rice, pasta, bananas, oatmeal, sports drinks
- Reduce fat and protein intake slightly

**Hydration Protocol**: Begin hydrating 48 hours before
- Increase fluid intake to ensure pale yellow urine
- Include electrolytes in final 24 hours
- Monitor hydration status continuously

### Race Morning Fueling (3-4 hours before start)
**Pre-Ride Meal**: 3-4g carbs per kg body weight
- Timing: 3-4 hours before start time
- Examples: Oatmeal with banana and honey, toast with jam
- Include 16-20oz fluid with electrolytes
- Avoid high fiber, fat, or unfamiliar foods

**Final Preparation**: 30-60 minutes before start
- Small carb snack: banana, energy bar, or sports drink
- Final 8-12oz fluid intake
- Stop drinking 30 minutes before to allow bathroom break

### During Century Fueling Strategy
**Carbohydrate Intake**: 60-90g per hour after first hour
- Start fueling at mile 15-20, don't wait for hunger
- Options: Sports drinks, gels, bananas, fig bars, sandwiches
- Vary fuel sources to prevent flavor fatigue
- Practice exact strategy during long training rides

**Hydration Protocol**: 20-32oz per hour depending on conditions
- Sip regularly every 10-15 minutes
- Include electrolytes for entire duration
- Monitor urine color at rest stops (should be pale yellow)
- Adjust for temperature and humidity conditions

**Fueling Timeline for Century**:
- **Miles 0-15**: Water and electrolytes only
- **Miles 15-30**: Begin regular fueling (gel + sports drink)
- **Miles 30-50**: Continue hourly fueling, add solid food
- **Miles 50-75**: Maintain fueling, consider caffeine
- **Miles 75-100**: Focus on liquids, final energy push

### Recovery Fueling (Within 30-60 minutes)
**Immediate Recovery**: 1-1.2g carbs + 0.3g protein per kg body weight
- Examples: Chocolate milk, recovery shake, sandwich
- Include 24-32oz fluid with electrolytes
- Focus on liquid calories if appetite is suppressed

## Position Optimization for Century Distance

### Bike Fit for Ultra-Endurance
**Comfort Priority**: Position must be sustainable for 5-8 hours

- **Segment 2 (25-50 miles)**: Find sustainable pace and position
- **Segment 3 (50-75 miles)**: Mental focus, maintain nutrition
- **Segment 4 (75-100 miles)**: Determination, controlled finish

**Positive Mental Strategies**:
- Develop personal mantras for difficult moments
- Practice visualization of successful century completion
- Focus on process goals rather than just distance remaining
- Use external focus: scenery, other riders, mechanical rhythm

### Dealing with Century Challenges
**Physical Discomfort Management**:
- Regular position changes and stretching
- Address discomfort early before it becomes problematic
- Know difference between discomfort and injury
- Have exit strategies for serious problems

**Mental Fatigue Strategies**:

## Program Philosophy and Mindset

The Century Ride Training Program recognizes that completing 100 miles on a bicycle is both a significant physical challenge and a meaningful personal achievement. Success requires not only cardiovascular fitness but also mechanical preparation, nutritional mastery, mental resilience, and the ability to maintain comfort and efficiency over extended periods.

This program emphasizes sustainable training practices that build confidence alongside fitness. The progression is designed to ensure that by century day, the physical, mental, and logistical challenges have all been successfully practiced and mastered during training.

Remember that completing a century ride represents joining a select group of cyclists who have demonstrated the commitment, preparation, and determination required for ultra-endurance achievement. This accomplishment opens doors to advanced cycling challenges and provides a foundation of confidence for whatever cycling goals you choose to pursue next.

The century distance demands respect, preparation, and humility, but rewards those who approach it systematically with an unforgettable sense of personal achievement and the knowledge that you can tackle significant challenges through proper preparation and determination.
