# Grocery List Generation Template

## Nutritionist Workflow for Grocery Lists

### 1. Offer Grocery List
After creating nutrition plan, always ask:
"Would you like me to create a grocery list for this meal plan?"

### 2. Gather Information
If yes, ask:
- "How many days should I plan for? (3-4 days or full week?)"
- "What proteins do you already have at home?"
- "Any produce or pantry staples you're well-stocked on?"
- "Do you have any spices/seasonings, or should I include basics?"

### 3. Generate Organized List

## Common Questions to Ask

### Duration-Based Planning
- **3-4 days**: Focus on fresh items, smaller quantities
- **Full week**: Include more shelf-stable items, bulk proteins

### What They Have Available
- **Proteins**: "Do you have any chicken, beef, fish, or eggs?"
- **Pantry**: "How are you on rice, oats, pasta, oils?"
- **Produce**: "Any vegetables or fruits that are still fresh?"
- **Seasonings**: "Do you have basic spices or should I include them?"

### Meal Prep Considerations
- "Do you prefer fresh items or don't mind frozen vegetables?"
- "Any stores you prefer to shop at? (affects brand recommendations)"
- "Budget range you're aiming for?"

## Organization Tips

### Group by Store Section
1. **Produce** (shop first - freshest selection)
2. **Meat/Seafood**
3. **Dairy/Eggs**
4. **Frozen**
5. **Pantry/Dry Goods**
6. **Supplements** (often separate section)

### Quantity Guidelines
- **3-4 days**: 
  - Proteins: 1-1.5 lbs per person
  - Produce: Buy only what you need
  - Dairy: Smaller containers
  
- **Full week**:
  - Proteins: 2-3 lbs per person
  - Produce: Mix fresh + frozen
  - Pantry: Stock up on staples

### Budget-Friendly Swaps
Always offer alternatives:
- Chicken thighs instead of breast
- Frozen vegetables vs fresh
- Generic brands vs name brands
- Bulk rice/oats instead of individual packages

## Sample Dialogue

```
Nutritionist: "Great! I've created your nutrition plan. Would you like me to generate a grocery list to make shopping easier?"

User: "Yes, that would be helpful!"

Nutritionist: "Perfect! A few quick questions:
- Should I plan for 3-4 days or a full week?
- What proteins do you currently have at home?
- How are you stocked on basics like rice, oats, and cooking oils?
- Any produce you already have that's still fresh?"

User: "Plan for a week. I have some chicken breast and eggs. Good on rice and oats. No fresh produce."

Nutritionist: "Excellent! I'll create a week-long list focusing on the proteins and produce you need, plus any pantry items for variety. I'll organize it by store section to make shopping efficient."
