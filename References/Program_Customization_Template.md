# Program Customization Template

## Universal Coach Approach

### 1. Event/Goal Analysis (ALWAYS START HERE)
Before asking any questions, explain:
```
"Based on my knowledge, here's what [EVENT/GOAL] entails:
- [Key physical demands]
- [Specific skills/abilities required]
- [Timeline considerations]
- [Common failure points]

Here's what we'll need to improve:
- [Primary fitness areas]
- [Secondary areas]
- [Mental/tactical components]

This program will cover:
- [Training phases]
- [Key exercises/activities]
- [Progression strategy]
- [What we might need to modify based on your situation]"
```

### 2. Essential Customization Questions
After the analysis, ask:
- Equipment availability
- Training partner availability
- Time constraints
- Experience level
- Injury/limitation history
- Location/environment factors

### 3. Program Adaptation
Based on answers, explain:
- What modifications you'll make
- Alternative exercises/approaches
- How this affects timeline/expectations

## Specific Program Examples

### GoRuck Selection Preparation

#### Event Analysis
```
"GoRuck Selection is an extreme endurance event that typically involves:
- 12-48+ hours of continuous movement
- Heavy ruck marching (30+ lbs) for long distances
- Team-based challenges and problem solving
- Sleep deprivation and mental stress
- Obstacle navigation and carrying teammates
- Swimming with gear (depending on location)
- Minimal food/water resupply

What we need to improve:
- Aerobic base and muscular endurance
- Load-bearing capacity (rucking strength)
- Mental toughness and stress inoculation
- Functional strength for team challenges
- Swimming endurance (if required)

This program covers:
- Progressive ruck march training (distance + weight)
- Strength training focused on carries and functional patterns
- Mental resilience building through discomfort training
- Team challenge simulations (if partner available)
- Swimming integration (if needed)
"
```

#### Customization Questions
- "Do you have a training partner? Many challenges are team-based."
- "Do you have access to sandbags, kettlebells, or just basic gym equipment?"
- "Is there swimming in your specific event? (GORUCK location-dependent)"
- "Can you ruck outdoors, or do we need treadmill alternatives?"
- "How many hours per week can you dedicate to this?"
- "Any previous military/endurance experience?"

### Ironman Training

#### Event Analysis
```
"Ironman is a 140.6-mile triathlon consisting of:
- 2.4-mile open water swim
- 112-mile bike ride
- 26.2-mile marathon run
- 17-hour time cutoff (most events)
- Performed consecutively without breaks

What we need to improve:
- Aerobic capacity across three disciplines
- Muscular endurance for 8-17 hours of activity
- Transition efficiency between sports
- Fueling and hydration strategy
- Mental stamina for ultra-distance effort

This program covers:
- Progressive volume in all three sports
- Brick workouts (bike-to-run transitions)
- Long weekend sessions (race simulation)
- Strength training for injury prevention
- Nutrition and pacing strategy
"
```

#### Customization Questions
- "Do you have access to a pool, or will we focus on open water?"
- "What's your bike setup? (Road bike, TT bike, indoor trainer?)"
- "Can you swim/bike/run outdoors year-round?"
- "How many hours per week can you train? (Ironman typically needs 12-20)"
- "Previous triathlon experience?"
- "Target race date? (Affects periodization)"

### Powerlifting Competition Prep

#### Event Analysis
```
"Powerlifting competition involves:
- Three attempts each in squat, bench press, deadlift
- 9 total lifts over 6-8 hours
- Weight increases between attempts (strategy critical)
- Commands and judging standards (timing/depth/lockout)
- Mental pressure of performing maximum lifts on demand

What we need to improve:
- Absolute strength in the three lifts
- Technical proficiency under fatigue
- Competition timing and strategy
- Mental preparation for max attempts
- Openers/second attempts/third attempt selection

This program covers:
- Periodized strength building (hypertrophy → strength → peaking)
- Competition simulation training
- Technical refinement with competition commands
- Accessory work for weak points
- Mental preparation and attempt selection strategy
"
```

#### Customization Questions
- "What federation are you competing in? (affects judging standards)"
- "Current PRs in squat/bench/deadlift?"
- "Competition date? (determines program length)"
- "Do you have a coach or training partner for spotting/commands?"
- "Any injury history with the three lifts?"
- "First competition or experienced competitor?"

### Marathon Training

#### Event Analysis
```
"Marathon racing (26.2 miles) requires:
- 2.5-6 hours of continuous running
- Aerobic energy system dominance
- Proper pacing strategy (negative or even splits)
- Fueling during the race (glycogen depletion around mile 20)
- Mental toughness through 'the wall'

What we need to improve:
- Aerobic base (easy mileage foundation)
- Lactate threshold (tempo running)
- Race pace familiarity
- Long run endurance
- Running economy and form

This program covers:
- Base building phase (easy miles)
- Build phase (tempo + interval work)
- Peak phase (race pace + taper)
- Long run progression
- Race day nutrition and pacing strategy
"
```

#### Customization Questions
- "Target race date and goal time?"
- "Current weekly mileage?"
- "Running surface preference/availability? (roads, trails, treadmill)"
- "Previous marathon experience?"
- "Any running injuries or concerns?"
- "Time available for training per week?"

## Equipment-Specific Adaptations

### Limited Equipment (Home Gym)
- Bodyweight alternatives
- Resistance band substitutions
