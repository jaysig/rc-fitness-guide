## Initial Coaching Session

### Program Request
**User:** "I want to start lifting weights to build muscle and get stronger"

**System Response:** Routes to powerlifting-coach agent

**Agent Analysis:**
"Based on my knowledge, here's what building muscle and strength entails:
- Progressive overload - gradually increasing weight/reps over time
- Compound movements that work multiple muscle groups
- Consistent training 3-4x per week for 3-6 months to see significant changes
- Adequate protein intake (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight)
- Proper recovery between sessions

Here's what we need to improve:
- Overall muscular strength and size
- Movement patterns and exercise technique
- Workout consistency and progressive loading

This program will cover:
- Foundation compound movements (squat, deadlift, bench, row)
- Upper/lower body split for optimal recovery
- Progressive rep and weight schemes
- Form coaching cues for safety"

### Customization Questions & Answers
- **Equipment:** "Full gym access with barbells, dumbbells, machines"
- **Training partner:** "Going solo, but gym staff available for spotting"
- **Experience:** "Complete beginner with weights"
- **Time:** "4 days per week, 1 hour sessions"
- **Limitations:** "No injuries, just nervous about proper form"

### Program Assignment

## Stretching (8 minutes)

### Chest Stretch
Doorway stretch - held the frame and stepped forward. Really felt it after all that benching! Hold for 30 seconds each arm.

### Shoulder Stretch  
Cross-body stretch helped with overhead press tightness. 30 seconds each side.

### Lat Stretch
Grabbed the pull-up bar and leaned back. Perfect after the pulldowns. 30 seconds.

---

## Post-Workout Notes
Amazing session! Bench press is getting challenging but form felt good. The failed rep on set 3 tells me I'm pushing the right intensity. 

Row felt easy - probably ready to increase weight next week. Overhead press is definitely my weak point but making progress.

Energy was good throughout. Pre-workout meal timing (2 hours before) seems perfect.

Total volume: 8,350 lbs - new weekly record!
