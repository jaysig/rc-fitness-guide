## Initial Coaching Session

### Program Request
**User:** "I want to train for my first marathon - Chicago in October, hoping to break 4 hours"

**System Response:** Routes to endurance-coach agent

**Agent Analysis:**
"Based on my knowledge, here's what marathon racing entails:
- 26.2 miles (42.2 km) of continuous running
- 3-5 hours of sustained aerobic effort for most first-timers
- Proper pacing strategy crucial (negative or even splits)  
- Fueling during race (glycogen depletion around mile 20-22)
- Mental toughness through 'the wall' - final 6 miles are hardest
- Peak weekly mileage typically 50-70 miles for sub-4 hour goal

Here's what we need to improve:
- Aerobic base through high-volume easy running
- Lactate threshold via tempo runs 
- Race pace familiarity and pacing discipline
- Long run endurance (up to 20-22 mile runs)
- Running economy and efficient form

This program will cover:
- 16-week periodized build (base → build → peak → taper)
- Progressive long run development
- Speed work and tempo training
- Race day nutrition and pacing strategy
- Injury prevention through strength work"

### Customization Questions & Answers

## Post-Run Recovery (30 minutes)

### Immediate (First 5 minutes)
- Walk 0.25 miles easy cool down
- Chocolate milk + banana within 15 minutes
- Lots of water with electrolytes

### Stretching Routine (15 minutes)

#### Hip Flexor Stretch
Low lunge position, really opened up tight hips from all the forward motion. 45 seconds each leg.

#### Calf Stretch  
Wall stretch, then downward dog. Calves were tight from 20 miles! 60 seconds each.

#### IT Band Stretch
Cross-leg stretch against wall. Preventive care since history of IT issues. 45 seconds each.

#### Quad Stretch
Standing quad stretch, held tree for balance. Quads surprisingly felt good. 30 seconds each.

#### Hamstring Stretch
Seated forward fold, gentle stretch. Hammies did most of the work today. 60 seconds.

### Ice Bath (10 minutes)
Cold tub at 55°F for 8 minutes. Legs felt instantly better!

## Post-Run Notes
Huge milestone - longest run ever! Pacing was perfect for first 15 miles, then reality hit. The last 5 miles were exactly what I needed to experience before race day.

Nutrition plan worked well - no stomach issues. Need to practice taking gels while running faster though.

Mentally, this was tough but doable. If I can do 20 at this pace, 26.2 at goal pace feels achievable.

Legs felt strong until mile 16, then it became about mental toughness. This is exactly the training effect I needed.

Recovery priority: sleep, nutrition, easy runs this week.
