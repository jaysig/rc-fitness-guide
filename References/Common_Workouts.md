## Creating Your Own Workouts

### Basic Workout Structure

#### Template Framework
1. **Warm-up** (5-10 minutes)
   - Raise heart rate
   - Prepare joints and muscles
   - Practice movement patterns

2. **Main Workout** (15-45 minutes)

   - Secondary exercises (isolation work)
   - Progress from heavy to light weights

3. **Cool-down** (5-10 minutes)
   - Lower heart rate gradually
   - Static stretching
   - Relaxation/breathing

### Exercise Selection Guidelines

#### Compound vs Isolation
**Compound movements** (multi-joint):
