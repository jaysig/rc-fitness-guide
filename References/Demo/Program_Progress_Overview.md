## Coach Notes

*"Excellent progress for first 3 weeks! Deadlift strength is impressive - natural pulling pattern. Squat breakthrough in Workout 7 shows the importance of patience with movement learning. OHP plateau is normal - this is typically the first lift to stall. Consider fractional plates and extra rest between OHP sets."*

**Next session preparation:**
- Extra 5-minute warm-up for shoulders
- Review squat depth cues from successful Workout 7
- Mental preparation for heavier deadlift (185 lbs will be new PR territory)
