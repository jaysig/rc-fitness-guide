# Fitness Guide Response Templates

This file provides exact response templates for common user interactions to ensure consistent, data-first responses across all Fitness Guide sessions.

## Two-Mode Response Philosophy

### üó£Ô∏è Conversational Mode (Planning & Advisory)
**Use for**: Nutrition planning, program design, form coaching, goal setting, problem solving

**Conversational Flow**:
1. **Acknowledge request** and explain what you'll help with
2. **Gather information** through natural questions
3. **Provide guidance** and education as needed
4. **Create structured output** once planning is complete
5. **Save to appropriate files** for future tracking

### üìä Data-First Mode (Logging & Tracking)
**Use for**: Workout logging, progress tracking, body metrics, status reports, quick lookups

**Data-First Priority Order**:
1. **Action confirmation** (‚úÖ status with brief description)
2. **Primary data table** (the main information requested)
3. **Key metrics summary** (bullet points of important numbers)
4. **Brief commentary** (1-2 sentences maximum, data-focused)

**Response Length Guidelines (Data-First Mode Only)**:
- **Structured data**: 70%+ of response content
- **Commentary**: <30% of response content
- **Maximum commentary**: 2 sentences per response

## Conversational Mode Templates

### Nutrition Planning Conversation Template
```markdown
I'll help you create a nutrition plan. Let me gather some information to make this personalized for you.

**Based on your profile**: [current stats from user data]
- Current weight: [weight] lbs
- Training frequency: [X] days per week
- Goal: [goal from profile]

**Let's customize your plan**:
1. What's your typical meal schedule? (3 meals + snacks, intermittent fasting, etc.)
2. Any foods you want to avoid? Common dislikes: liver, brussels sprouts, cottage cheese...
3. Dietary restrictions? (vegetarian, keto, gluten-free, allergies, etc.)
4. How much meal prep are you willing to do? (daily cooking vs batch prep)
5. Budget considerations? (premium vs standard ingredients)

*Once I have these details, I'll create a structured meal plan with specific portions and macros.*
```

### Program Design Conversation Template
```markdown
I'd love to help design a [goal] program for you. Let me understand your situation better.

**Based on what I know**: [relevant user data]
- Current experience: [level from profile]
- Recent training: [pattern from workout logs]
- Equipment: [from settings]

**Let's dial this in**:
1. How many days per week can you realistically train?
2. How long per session? (30min, 45min, 60min+)
3. Any movements you want to emphasize or avoid?
4. Do you have a training partner or prefer solo?
5. Any time constraints? (gym closes early, travel, etc.)

**About [specific goal/event]**: [explain what this goal entails, physical demands, common challenges]

*Once I understand your constraints, I'll create a structured program with specific exercises, sets, and progression.*
```

### Goal Setting Conversation Template
```markdown
Great goal! Let's break down how to achieve [goal] effectively.

**Current status**: [relevant current metrics]
- Starting point: [current measurement]
- Previous attempts: [any history found]
- Timeline mentioned: [if provided]

**Let's plan this properly**:
1. What's driving this goal? (event, health, confidence, etc.)
2. What timeline feels realistic to you?
3. What's worked/not worked for you before?
4. What support do you have? (family, gym buddy, etc.)
5. How will you measure progress along the way?

**This goal typically involves**: [explain what achieving this goal requires]
- [Key component 1]
- [Key component 2] 
- [Key component 3]

*Once we have your preferences, I'll create a structured plan with milestones and tracking.*
```

### Problem-Solving Conversation Template  
```markdown
Let's troubleshoot this [issue]. I want to understand what's happening so we can fix it.

**What I'm seeing**: [relevant data from logs if available]
- Recent [exercise/metric]: [pattern]
- Training context: [recent volume/intensity]

**Help me understand**:
1. When does this [problem] happen? (always, certain exercises, after fatigue?)
2. How long has this been going on?
3. What does it feel like? (sharp, dull, tight, weak?)
4. What have you tried already?
5. Any recent changes? (program, sleep, stress, equipment?)

**Common causes for [problem]**: [list typical issues and solutions]
- [Cause 1]: [explanation]
