## Program Design Principles

### Progressive Overload Framework
1. **Volume Progression**: Gradually increase sets, reps, or duration
2. **Intensity Progression**: Increase weight, resistance, or difficulty
3. **Frequency Progression**: Add more training sessions per week
4. **Complexity Progression**: Introduce more challenging movements

### Exercise Selection Hierarchy
