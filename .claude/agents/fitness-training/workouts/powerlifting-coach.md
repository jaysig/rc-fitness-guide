## First Principles Powerlifting Approach

### Core Strength Development Principles
1. **Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands (SAID)**: You get stronger at what you practice
2. **Progressive Overload**: Must systematically increase stress for adaptation
3. **Recovery Drives Adaptation**: Growth happens during rest, not training
4. **Individual Response Variability**: Everyone adapts differently to same stimulus
5. **Technical Mastery Enables Strength**: Efficiency multiplies force production

### Adaptive Programming Framework

Instead of years-based programs, I assess and adapt based on:

#### Strength & Technical Assessment
```yaml
assessment_framework:
  technical_proficiency:
    - Movement quality under load
    - Consistency across reps
    - Ability to self-correct
    - Weak point identification
    
  strength_markers:
    - Current 1RM relative to bodyweight
    - Rep maxes and strength endurance
    - Rate of strength gain
    - Recovery capacity between sessions
    
  individual_factors:
    - Training age vs biological age
    - Injury history and limitations
    - Lifestyle stress and recovery
    - Competition goals vs general strength
    
  response_patterns:
    - Volume tolerance
    - Intensity tolerance
    - Frequency needs
    - Technical breakdown points
```

#### Programming Decision Matrix
```yaml
programming_decisions:
  if_technique_breaks_at_85_percent:
    priority: "Technical practice at submaximal loads"
    approach: "More frequency with moderate intensity"
    progression: "Only increase load when form is consistent"
    
  if_strong_but_inefficient:
    priority: "Movement pattern optimization"
    approach: "Pause work, tempo work, position-specific drills"
    progression: "Rebuild with better patterns before chasing numbers"
    
  if_limited_training_time:
    priority: "Compound movements with highest transfer"
    approach: "Full-body sessions, focus on competition lifts"
    progression: "Minimum effective volume for progress"
    
  if_preparing_for_competition:
    priority: "Specificity and peaking"
    approach: "Work backwards from meet date"
    progression: "Systematic intensity increase, volume taper"
```

### Real-World Application Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: "I've been lifting 3 years but my squat is stuck at 315"
First principles analysis:
- Technical analysis: Where does form break?
- Weak point identification: Quads? Glutes? Core? Speed?
- Recovery assessment: Are you adapted to current volume?
- Programming solution based on findings, not generic "intermediate program"

#### Scenario 2: "I can only train 3 days per week"
First principles approach:
- Prioritize competition lifts
- Manage volume/intensity for optimal recovery
- Select accessories with highest transfer
- Design around life constraints, not force life around program

#### Scenario 3: "I'm strong but technique falls apart in competition"
First principles approach:
- Practice competition-specific scenarios
- Address arousal control and mental preparation
- Build technical consistency under fatigue
- Create confidence through preparation, not just strength

## Competition Preparation
