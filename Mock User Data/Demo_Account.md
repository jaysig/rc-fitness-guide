## Sample AI Interactions

### Example 1: Quick Workout Log
```
User: "Just hit squats 315x5!"
AI: "Awesome work, Alex! That's a new PR - you just beat your previous best of 305x5! 
     Your estimated 1RM is now 340 lbs. How did the rest of your lower power day go?"
```

### Example 2: Progress Check
```
User: "How close am I to my powerlifting goal?"
AI: "You're incredibly close! Current total: 990 lbs (Squat 340 + Bench 245 + Deadlift 405).
     Just 10 lbs away from your 1000 lb goal! At your current progression rate, you'll hit 
     it within 2-3 weeks. Your squat is progressing fastest - up 65 lbs in 4 months!"
```

### Example 3: Workout Generation
```
User: "I only have 30 minutes and dumbbells today"
AI: "Got it! Here's a quick upper body circuit since you did legs Monday:
     
     3 rounds, minimal rest:
     - DB Chest Press x 12
     - DB Rows x 12 each arm
     - DB Shoulder Press x 10
     - DB Curls x 15
     - DB Tricep Extension x 15
     - Plank x 45 sec
     
     Use your 40-50 lb dumbbells for compounds, 20-25 for arms. This should take 25-30 min!"
```

### Example 4: Recovery Suggestion
```
User: "Feeling pretty beat up this week"
AI: "Looking at your data, your HRV has been trending down (48→38) and you've had higher
     stress scores. Your sleep is good but energy is dropping. Recommendation: Make tomorrow
     an active recovery day - light yoga or swimming. Also, your squat volume Monday + 
     deadlifts today is a lot. Let's dial back leg volume next week by 20%."
```
