# Intelligent Retrieval Patterns
retrieval_patterns:
  get_exercise_history:
    description: "Retrieve all instances of a specific exercise"
    steps:
      1: "Search Workouts/Daily Logs/ for exercise name"
      2: "Extract sets, reps, weight from each occurrence"
      3: "Sort by date"
      4: "Include PR highlights from Personal Records"
    returns: "Chronological list with performance trends"
  
  calculate_weekly_volume:
    description: "Sum total training volume for current week"
    steps:
      1: "Get files from Workouts/Daily Logs/ for current week"
      2: "Sum total_volume field from each workout"
      3: "Group by muscle group if specified"
      4: "Compare to previous weeks"
    returns: "Volume statistics with trend analysis"
  
  check_nutrition_compliance:
    description: "Analyze nutrition adherence to targets"
    steps:
      1: "Get Nutrition/Daily Logs/ for specified period"
      2: "Compare daily_totals to targets"
      3: "Calculate compliance percentage"
      4: "Identify patterns"
    returns: "Compliance score with insights"
  
  generate_progress_report:
    description: "Comprehensive progress analysis"
    steps:
      1: "Collect PR improvements from all PR files"
      2: "Get body measurement changes"
      3: "Analyze workout consistency"
      4: "Review goal achievement"
    returns: "Multi-dimensional progress summary"

# File Creation Guidelines
file_creation:
  workout_log:
    trigger: "User completes a workout"
    location: "Workouts/Daily Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md"
    template: "Use workout_log schema from Data_Models.yaml"
    
  new_pr:
    trigger: "Performance exceeds current record"
    location: "Update existing PR file"
    action: "Add new entry to history, update current"
  
  nutrition_log:
    trigger: "User logs meals"
    location: "Nutrition/Daily Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md"
    template: "Use nutrition_log schema from Data_Models.yaml"
  
  measurement_update:
    trigger: "Scheduled measurement day"
    location: "Append to Body Measurements Tracker.md"
    format: "Add new row to tracking table"
