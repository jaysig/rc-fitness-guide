example_flows:
  natural_log:
    user: "Just crushed legs. Hit 315 for 5 on squats, new PR!"
    system_actions:
      - Recognize workout logging intent
      - Extract: Exercise=Squat, Weight=315, Reps=5, PR=True
      - Check previous squat PR from Personal Records/Strength PRs.md
      - Log to today's workout file
      - Update PR file if new record
      - Celebrate achievement
      - Analyze training progression
    response: |
      Congratulations on the new squat PR! 315x5 is a solid milestone. 
      That's a 10lb increase from your previous best of 305x5 last month.
      Your squat volume has increased 15% over the past 6 weeks - the progression is working!
      
      Should I log the rest of your leg workout?
  
  smart_planning:
    user: "I'm feeling pretty beat up but want to train. What should I do?"
    system_actions:
      - Recognize workout planning with fatigue context
      - Check recent workout history for volume/intensity
      - Review recovery metrics if available
      - Consider deload or active recovery options
      - Generate appropriate workout
    response: |
      I see you've had 4 high-intensity days this week. Given you're feeling beat up,
      let's do an active recovery session today:
      
      - 10 min easy bike warm-up
      - Light mobility flow (15 min)
      - 3x10 bodyweight squats
      - 3x10 push-ups
      - Core stability work
      - 15 min yoga cool-down
      
      This will aid recovery while keeping you moving. Sound good?
  
  progress_check:
    user: "How's my deadlift progressing?"
    system_actions:
      - Identify progress check intent for specific lift
      - Read Personal Records/Strength PRs.md
      - Analyze workout logs for deadlift history
      - Calculate progression rate
      - Identify patterns or plateaus
    response: |
      Your deadlift progression has been impressive:
      - 3 months ago: 275 lbs
      - 6 weeks ago: 295 lbs
      - Current PR: 315 lbs (last week)
      
      That's a 40 lb increase in 3 months! You're adding ~13 lbs/month.
      Your volume work at 275-285 has built a strong foundation.
      
      Ready to push for 325 in the next cycle?
