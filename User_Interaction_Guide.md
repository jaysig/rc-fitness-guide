# Fitness Guide User Interaction Guide

## How to Use Your Fitness Guide

The Fitness Guide is a conversational fitness management system. You simply talk naturally about your fitness needs, and the AI understands what you want and handles it for you.

## Main Entry Points

### 1. Natural Language Interaction (Primary)

Just start talking about what you need:

**Logging Activities:**
- "Just finished my workout - squats 315x5, bench 225x8"
- "Crushed a 5K run in 23:45!"
- "Weighed in at 178 this morning"
- "Slept terribly last night, only 5 hours"

**Getting Information:**
- "What should I do for today's workout?"
- "Show me my squat progress"
- "How was my week?"
- "What's my current bench press PR?"

**Planning & Goals:**
- "I want to get stronger"
- "Help me train for a marathon"
- "Create a workout for tomorrow"
- "I have 30 minutes and only dumbbells"

**Questions & Guidance:**
- "How do I do a proper deadlift?"
- "My shoulder hurts during bench press"
- "What's a good substitute for pull-ups?"
- "Should I bulk or cut?"

### 2. Structured Navigation (Optional)

For users who prefer menus, you can ask:
- "Show me the main menu"
- "What are my options?"

This will present:
1. Log today's workout
2. Plan or generate a workout  
3. Review Progress & Analytics
4. Ask a question
5. Update goals or coaching plan

## Natural Conversation Flow

### Example 1: Post-Workout
```
You: "Just crushed legs - squats were heavy but got 315 for 5!"
AI: "Awesome work! Let me log that for you. 315x5 on squats - that's a new PR! 🎉 
     You're 10 lbs stronger than last month. How did the rest of the workout go?"
You: "Also did leg press and lunges, but I'm wiped"
AI: "Got it. I'll log those too. Given that intensity, I'd recommend an easier 
     upper body session tomorrow. Want me to plan it for you?"
```

### Example 2: Planning
```
You: "What should I do today?"
AI: "Looking at your recent workouts, you did upper body 2 days ago and legs yesterday.
     Today would be perfect for some cardio or active recovery. You mentioned wanting
     to improve your 5K time - how about some interval training?"
You: "Sounds good but I only have 30 minutes"
AI: "Perfect. Here's a quick interval session: 5 min warmup, then 6x (2 min hard,
     1 min easy), finish with 5 min cooldown. That'll help your 5K speed!"
```

### Example 3: Progress Check
```
You: "How's my bench press going?"
AI: "Your bench press is progressing nicely! Current PR: 225x5 (last week)
     - Started at 185x5 three months ago (+40 lbs!)
     - You're adding about 5 lbs every 2-3 weeks
     - Form has been solid based on your notes
     At this rate, you'll hit 2 plates (225x8-10) within a month!"
```
