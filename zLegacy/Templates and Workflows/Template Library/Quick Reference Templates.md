## üîß Troubleshooting Templates

### Low Completion Recovery

```markdown

## Honest Assessment

**Main obstacles**: [Time/motivation/complexity/life events]
**System burden level**: [How heavy does tracking feel? 1-10]
**Value perception**: [How helpful is the data? 1-10]

## Immediate Simplification
**This week's minimal commitment**:
- [ ] Daily: [One simple check - energy level only]
- [ ] Workout: [Just completion Y/N + basic quality rating]
- [ ] Weekly: [Skip detailed analysis, just celebrate what you did]

## Troubleshooting Questions
- Is the system too complex for current life circumstances?
- Are you tracking things that don't actually help you?
- What's the minimum that would still feel valuable?
- How can you lower the bar while maintaining the habit?

## Recovery Plan
**Week 1**: Ultra-minimal tracking to rebuild habit
**Week 2**: Add one element back if Week 1 felt sustainable
**Week 3**: Gradual complexity increase if motivation allows
**Week 4**: Assess new sustainable level

*Remember: A simple system you use beats a perfect system you abandon.*
