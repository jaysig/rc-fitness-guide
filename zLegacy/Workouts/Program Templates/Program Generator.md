    measurement: "[weight achieved]"
  
  - exercise: "[Secondary lift]"
    test_type: "[rep test at bodyweight]"
    measurement: "[reps completed]"

body_composition:
  - measurement: "[weight/body_fat/circumferences]"
    baseline_value: "[starting measurement]"

performance_tests:

    baseline: "[starting performance]"
```

### Mid-Program Assessment (Week [X])
