- **Focus**: Ensure sharp focus on entire body
- **Multiple Shots**: Take 3-5 of each pose, select best

## LLM-Assisted Photo Analysis

### XML Prompt for Progress Photo Analysis
```xml
<progress_photo_analysis>
<instructions>
I need help analyzing my progress photos to identify changes and improvements. Guide me through a systematic comparison and help me see changes I might miss due to daily familiarity with my appearance.

Current session: [Date and session number]
Comparison period: [Photos being compared - e.g., "8 weeks ago"]
Program context: [Current program and goals]
Body weight change: [Weight difference between photo sessions]
</instructions>

<comparison_framework>
<overall_assessment>
Help me evaluate overall visual changes:
1. First impression comparison - what's the most noticeable difference?
2. Body composition changes - where do I see fat loss or muscle gain?
3. Posture improvements - any changes in alignment or carriage?
4. Proportion changes - how have body proportions shifted?
5. Definition improvements - where is muscle definition more visible?
</overall_assessment>

<region_specific_analysis>
Guide me through each body region systematically:

Upper body analysis:
- Chest/pectoral development and definition
- Shoulder width and definition changes
- Arm size and definition (biceps, triceps, forearms)
- Back width and muscle definition
- Neck and trap development

Midsection analysis:
- Abdominal definition and visibility
- Waist circumference visual assessment
- Love handle/side fat changes
- Lower back definition
- Overall core stability appearance

Lower body analysis:
- Thigh muscle development (quads, hamstrings)
- Glute development and shape
- Calf muscle definition
- Overall leg proportions
- Hip area changes

Overall physique:
- Muscle mass distribution
- Body fat distribution changes
- Symmetry improvements
- Vascularity changes
- Skin quality/appearance
</region_specific_analysis>

<motivational_assessment>
Help me recognize achievements:
1. What progress should I be most proud of?
2. What changes might others notice most?
3. How do these changes reflect my training focus?
4. What improvements support my goals?
5. Where am I exceeding my own expectations?
</motivational_assessment>

<areas_for_focus>
Identify areas needing attention:
1. Body regions showing less progress than expected
2. Asymmetries or imbalances to address
3. Areas where more development would enhance overall physique
4. Posture issues still needing work
5. Goals that photos suggest need program adjustments
</areas_for_focus>
</comparison_framework>

<progress_documentation>
Format findings as:
1. Progress summary table comparing key measurements/observations
2. Bullet points of specific improvements noticed
3. Areas of concern or needed focus
4. Motivational highlights of achievement
5. Recommendations for next photo session focus
6. Program adjustment suggestions based on visual progress

## Motivation & Mindset Integration

### Photo Session Mindset Preparation
| Before Session | During Session | After Session |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Focus on progress, not perfection | Maintain confidence and good posture | Celebrate the commitment to document progress |
| Remember this is documentation, not judgment | Take multiple shots without self-criticism | Look for improvements, however small |
| Hydrate appropriately but don't overdo | Focus on consistency over "perfect" shots | Note non-visual improvements (strength, energy) |
| Light warm-up for good posture | Maintain realistic expectations | Plan celebration of progress milestones |

### Progress Celebration Framework
| Progress Type | Recognition Method | Sharing Decision | Reward System |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| First major change visible | [How to celebrate] | [Private/Share with close friends/Public] | [Reward plan] |
| Milestone achievements | [Celebration approach] | [Sharing approach] | [Reward system] |
| Consistency achievements | [Recognition method] | [Sharing decision] | [Reward plan] |
| Unexpected improvements | [Celebration style] | [Sharing preference] | [Reward approach] |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Technical Problems & Solutions
| Issue | Cause | Solution | Prevention |
|-------|-------|---------|------------|
| Inconsistent lighting | Time of day variation | Use same time daily | Set consistent session schedule |
| Blurry photos | Camera shake/poor focus | Use tripod/timer function | Check settings before each session |
| Poor framing | Inconsistent distance | Mark camera position | Use reference markers |
| Shadow issues | Wrong lighting angle | Adjust position relative to light | Document optimal setup |

### Motivation Challenges
| Challenge | Common Cause | Solution Strategy | Long-term Approach |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Not seeing changes | Daily familiarity effect | Focus on measurements & feedback | Trust the process, extend comparison periods |
| Feeling discouraged | Unrealistic timeline expectations | Adjust expectations, celebrate small wins | Document non-visual improvements too |
| Consistency struggles | Life disruptions | Build flexibility into schedule | Link to other habits for consistency |
| Comparison paralysis | Social media influence | Focus on personal progress only | Limit exposure to comparison triggers |
