## LLM Data Collection Prompts

### XML Prompt for Body Measurements
```xml
<body_measurement_session>
<instructions>
I need to collect my body measurements systematically. Please guide me through each measurement and help me record the data accurately. Ask for each measurement one at a time and provide specific instructions for consistency.

Current date: [Today's date]
Measurement conditions: [Morning fasted / Evening / Other]
Equipment available: [Scale type, measuring tape, body fat analyzer, etc.]
</instructions>

<measurement_protocol>
Please walk me through:
1. Weight measurement - ask for current weight and note any factors (hydration, recent meals, etc.)
2. Body fat percentage - if I have a scale that measures this
3. Chest measurement - provide instruction for consistent placement
4. Waist measurement - guide me to find narrowest point
5. Hip measurement - widest point guidance
6. Arm measurements - both arms, flexed position
7. Thigh measurements - both thighs, largest point
8. Any additional metrics my equipment can provide

For each measurement, ask me to:
- Take the measurement 2-3 times for accuracy
- Note any unusual factors or conditions
- Compare to previous measurements if I have them available
</measurement_protocol>

<data_formatting>
Once complete, format all data as a markdown table entry that I can copy directly into my tracking table, including:
- Date
- All measurements with units
- Calculated BMI if possible
- Notes about conditions or observations
- Comparison to previous entry if I provide it
</data_formatting>
</body_measurement_session>
```

## Measurement Instructions & Tips

### Consistency Guidelines
- **Same time of day** (preferably morning, fasted)
- **Same clothing** (minimal, form-fitting)
- **Same hydration status** (track water intake before measuring)
- **Same body position** for circumference measurements
- **Same equipment** when possible

### Measurement Technique
#### Weight & Body Composition
- Step on scale 2-3 times for consistency
- Record any factors affecting measurement (recent meals, hydration, etc.)
- Use same scale consistently if possible

#### Circumference Measurements
- **Chest**: At nipple line, arms relaxed at sides, normal breathing
- **Waist**: At narrowest point, usually just above hip bones
- **Hips**: At widest point including buttocks
- **Arms**: At largest point when flexed, measure both sides
- **Thighs**: At largest point, measure both sides
- **Tape position**: Snug but not compressing tissue

### Data Entry Protocol
1. Complete all measurements in one session
2. Record immediately to avoid forgetting
3. Note any unusual circumstances
4. Calculate changes from previous measurement
5. Update goal progress tracking
6. Schedule next measurement session
